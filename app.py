Binary Tree: In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each 
node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child 
and the right child.

Binary Search Tree: In computer science, a binary search tree, also called an ordered or sorted 
binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key 
greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in 
its right subtree.

Following are the basic operations of a tree,
- Search: Searches an element in a tree.
- Insert: Inserts an element in a tree.
- Pre-order Traversal: Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.
- In-order Traversal: Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.
- Post-order Traversal: Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
